      The world is changing fast. Can your current marketing plan keep up?
    </h3>
    <p>
      It seems like every month managing and scaling your social media campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube,
      Google, Snapchat, TikTok and all the others gets harder and harder. New privacy regulations threaten existing
      campaigns, new competition drives up costs, and new ad policies restrict what you can & can’t do.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe business leaders should be freed to lead their business, and not spend
      their time wasting away in the media buying jungle.

          The best place to start is booking a call with us to see if we could be a good fit for each other. Next up
          would be to get our team to do a Strategic Growth Plan for your business which will identify the biggest
          levers that can unlock your business potential. Should we then agree to work with each other, we’d schedule an
          onboarding call(s) where you’d meet the team who’d be working with you to review and implement the strategic
          growth plan. We require a 120 day initial period of working with each other once we start – this is because it
          takes time, effort and patience to implement our game-changing strategies.

          Our fee schedule is based on the recommendations (prescriptions) made via the Strategic Growth Plan. This can
          be different for every customer because it really depends on your unique business’s needs. One important thing
          to note is that our fee schedule also decreases the more you scale your ad spend. No, we are not the cheapest
          agency on the market. Yes, we are worth every penny that we ask for!

          This is a valid question that comes up again and again – and for good reason. One of the most complicated
          parts of advertising is having to spin up new creative on a whim. Luckily, here at Tier 11, we have a
          world-class copy and creative team that is here to whip up scripts, ad copy, videos, gifs, images, you name
          it, our creative team has it covered! And what’s even better, is we use proprietary systems to not only
          create, but to perpetually iterate creative and copy on your behalf. That way, you’ll never ‘run out’ of ideas
          or new creative.
